# Salary-prediction-using-Polynomial-Linear-Regression

The algorithm uses polynomial linear regression to predict salaries from employee position (see dataset). 
A PLR model is built using analysis of SLR models of first 3 powers of independent variables w.r.t the dependent variable.
It is then compared with the linear Regression function of sklearn library.
The PLR model gives 91 % accuracy as compared to the linear regression function with 95 % accuracy.
One can use the PLR model to tune their regression curve as all coefficients and regression curve equation is available and editable.
